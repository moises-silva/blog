Hi! I am Moises, dad of two great kids, husband and software engineer living in Toronto, Canada. I was born in Mexico and immigrated to Canada in 2008. I also lived in Budapest, Hungary with my family for a bit more than a year in 2019/2020.

I used to be engineering director at [LogMeIn](https://logmein.com/) (now the company split off as [GoTo](https://goto.com/)). The company built products to connect and protect the remote workforce such as GoToConnect, GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC and LastPass. I worked in the GoToConnect division.

I am currently an engineering manager at Google leading a team of backend engineers taking care of key security and infrastructure development initiatives in the Google Workspace & Chat Platform.

This is my personal blog and opinions here are entirely my own. You'll find articles about engineering and management topics that I find interesting. I also used to have an [old wordpress blog](https://moythreads.com/wordpress/) with a lot of information about open source VoIP with FreeSWITCH and Asterisk, Linux and C/C++ programming topics.  

You can learn more about my professional experience in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moisessilva/). If you want to contact me you can find my information at the bottom of each page in this blog. I love engaging with other people passionate about tech, don't hesitate in reaching out.
