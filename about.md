Hi! I am Moises, dad of two great kids, husband and software engineer living in Toronto, Canada (kind of). I was born in Mexico and immigrated to Canada around 2008. I also lived in Budapest, Hungary with my family for a bit more than a year in 2019/2020.

I am currently an engineering director at [LogMeIn](http://logmein.com/), where we build products to connect and protect the remote workforce such as GoToConnect, GoToMeeting, GoToMyPC and LastPass.

This is my personal blog and opinions here are entirely my own. You'll find articles about engineering and management topics that I encounter on a regular basis. I also used to have an [old wordpress blog](https://moythreads.com/wordpress/) that you can still find useful with a lot of information about open source VoIP with FreeSWITCH and Asterisk.  

You can learn more about my professional experience in my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/moisessilva/). If you want to contact me you can find my information at the bottom of each page. I love engaging with other people passionate about tech, don't hesitate in reaching out.
